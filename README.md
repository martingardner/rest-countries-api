# Caveats

- the nation flags are not normalized data from the api. I chose to keep the integrity of the flag rather than destroy them to make them all the same height and width. Not all 250 flags in this api have the same ratio.
- There is a lot of inconsistancy between the style-guide and the jpegs, since I refuse to pay in order to get the rest of the code assessment that should've been supplied free of charge.
